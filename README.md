## Image Compressor Desktop App üóúÔ∏èüñºÔ∏èÔ∏è

### üîµ This project is an image size reducer

In the easiest possible way, you just need to give the program a folder containing your photos, and by pressing a button, all the steps will be done automatically, and at the end, you will receive an output containing reduced size images.

### üîµ Technologies
This program uses [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) technology, which is a JavaScript framework for creating desktop programs. üíª

Electron is a powerful framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By embedding Chromium and Node.js into its binary, Electron enables web developers to create cross-platform apps that work seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, without requiring native development experience.

And besides, [React.js](https://react.dev/) library and several other tools have been used

React is a JavaScript library designed for creating user interfaces (UIs) in web applications. Developed by Facebook in 2011, React allows developers to build dynamic, high-performing UIs using a component-based architecture.

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) is used in the project for styling, which is a modern tool for using CSS, and [Framer Motion](https://framer.com) is also used, and the animations in the project are written with this library.

Tailwind CSS is an open-source CSS framework that takes a unique approach to styling web applications. Unlike traditional frameworks like Bootstrap, which provide predefined classes for specific elements (such as buttons or tables), Tailwind CSS focuses on utility classes. These utility classes are like building blocks that you can mix and match to style your components.

Finally, the [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library has been used in the project to reduce the size of the photos

Sharp is a high-performance image processing module for Node.js. It‚Äôs designed to handle common image formats and provides lightning-fast operations like resizing, rotation, extraction, compositing, and gamma correction.
